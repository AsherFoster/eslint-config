# UNICEF NZ Javascript Style Guide

Check out [Installing](/doc/installing.md) for instructions installing the ESLint plugin

## Style Choices
This guide extends [Airbnb's JS style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with a few
opinionated tweaks to make your life easier.

- comma-dangle is disabled
- react/jsx-filename-extension is disabled
- prefer-template is disabled
- arrow-parens has been loosened so simple expressions don't require parentheses
- max-len has been bumped up to 140 characters. You could put a tweet on every line!
